    preamble:
      "Nearly 3 in 4 CFOs say their expense processes are still too manual, and that’s a problem. When your team spends hours setting up receipts, reconciling reports, or approving claims, those lost hours could be spent driving strategy or growth. This article outlines seven practical AI-driven solutions to reduce friction and automate the repetitive work that slows teams down.",

          "Expense management remains a painful bottleneck for many startups. Fragmented receipts, inconsistent tagging, delayed approvals, and manual reconciliation consume finance teams’ time and create reporting blind spots.

    conclusion:
      "AI can convert expense processing from a months-long pain into an automated, auditable workflow. For startups, that means more time for strategy and less time reconciling receipts — and a clearer, faster path to scale."
